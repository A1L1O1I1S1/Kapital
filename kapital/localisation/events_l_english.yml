Not since the Thirty Years' War has Berlin seen comparable devastation - considering its growth, this was seen as an impossibility.\n\nThe Führerbunker appears to have survived the blast at least partially due to the bomb detonating away from its planned epicenter, and [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] is rumored to still be alive, if outraged.

The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state.

However, even the vastness of [From.From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy.

The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack.

The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected.

There is a hidden struggle throughout our country between our supporters and the bourgeois. It's now time for us to choose our next move. We can do nothing and wait for our opponents to make their move first, although a more radical solution is also available. We can use our influence in the country to purge the counterrevolutionary elements with the help of repressions and brute force, or, without creating superfluous noise, eliminate the most influential opposition leaders, decapitating the latter, and then using our agents to destroy the revolution from within. Some party leaders offer a different option, however. Relax our agitation efforts, and consolidate ties with the army instead, fall back to our strongholds and prepare to resolve the issue with the help of bullets.
